        Hi my name is Krish. I grew up in Burlington Township,
        New Jersey. My passion for computer science began
        in middle school when my computer class teacher
        introduced us to code.org. From there on I would often
        try and familiarize myself with coding and trying to program
        the little games from code.org. In high school I joined the
        FIRST robotics team, where I quickly became a core member of the 
        team as a programmer. I programmed the robot's autonomous movements
        as well as key functions such as moving, shooting balls, and climbing.
        I found my work on the team to be very fun and decided to pursue 
        computer science as a major. After several projects and internships, I 
        have gained a lot of experience in this field. I am thankful to my mentors 
        that have guided me to where I am but even more so cannot wait to see where my future takes me.
